Now if we want to change the inner energy of the gas we can - according to the first law of Thermodaynamics - either add/remove heat from the system or do work on the gas or let the gas do work on the environment. In a formula you can write the first law of Thermodynamics like this\nFirst law of Thermodynamics # $$dU = dQ + dW$$ where \\(dU\\) is the change of the inner energy of the gas, \\(dQ\\) is the amount exchanged heat and \\(dW\\) is the amount of work being done on the gas/ on the environment. Adiabatic process # Per definition during an adiabatic process no heat is exchanged with the environment. This can e.g. be approximately true for a very fast change in volume where there is almost no time to allow heat flow during this process. For us this is very convinient as we can now write the first law like this\n$$dU = dW$$\nThe inner energy \\(U\\) for an ideal gas is defined by $$U = \\frac{f}{2} N k_B T$$ where \\(f\\) is the degree of freedom for the gas, \\(N\\) the number of gas particles, \\(k_B\\) the Boltzmann constant and \\(T\\) the temperature of the gas. As \\(T\\) is the only variable that might change during the adiabatc process we can write the change of inner energy as $$dU = \\frac{f}{2} N k_B dT$$\nThe work done on the gas/ on the environment is given by $$dW = -p dV$$ where \\(p\\) is the pressure and \\(dV\\) the change of volume during the process.\nCombining those to the first equation we get $$\\frac{f}{2} N k_B dT = -p dV$$\nNow let\u0026rsquo;s introduce probably the most essential identity of Thermodynamics The ideal gas law # $$p V = N k_B T$$ where \\(p\\) is the pressure, \\(V\\) the volume, \\(N\\) the number of gas particles, \\(k_B\\) the Boltzmann constant and \\(T\\) the temperature of the gas. We can now apply the differential operator to get \\(dp V + p dV = N k_B dT\\) and insert this into our equation $$\\frac{f}{2} (V dp + p dV) = -p dV$$ $$(\\frac{f}{2}+1) p dV = -\\frac{f}{2} V dp$$ $$\\frac{f+2}{f} \\frac{1}{V} dV = -\\frac{1}{p} dp$$\nwhere one defines \\(\\gamma = \\frac{f+2}{f}\\) as the adiabatic index.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s integrate this equation on both sides\n$$\\gamma ln(V) = -ln(p) + const.$$\nUsing \\(a ln(x) = ln(x^a)\\) and \\(ln(x) + ln(y) = ln(xy)\\) we get $$p V^\\gamma = const.$$ where \\(p\\) is the pressure, \\(V\\) the volume and \\(\\gamma\\) the adiabatic index of the gas. Now by inserting \\(p = \\frac{1}{V} N k_B T\\) we get $$N k_B T V^{-1} V^\\gamma = const.$$ $$ T V^{\\gamma-1} = const.$$ where \\(T\\) is the temperature, \\(V\\) the volume and \\(\\gamma\\) the adiabatic index of the gas.

It was originally developed by Linus Torvalds himselfwith the first release back in 2005. SSH and GPG are quite intersting for the use with git however there are not many easy guides on how to set these up. So here is a compact article.\nGet Started # When trying to create your first commit git wants to know some info about you:\nAuthor identity unknown *** Please tell me who you are. Run git config --global user.email \u0026#34;you@example.com\u0026#34; git config --global user.name \u0026#34;Your Name\u0026#34; to set your account\u0026#39;s default identity. Omit --global to set the identity only in this repository. So obviously follow the inctructions and configure your email and name with:\ngit config --global user.email \u0026#34;you@example.com\u0026#34; git config --global user.name \u0026#34;Your Name\u0026#34; GPG key # First you can install the seahorse app, a password \u0026amp; encryption key manager. Using Arch Linux or Manjaro you can do that with:\nsudo pacman -S seahorse Then add a GPG key.\nEnter a name, and the same email address that you use for your Github account.\nAfter entering the passphrase for this key export the public key.\nCopy the content of the exported file, sign in to your Github account and go to Settings-\u0026gt;SSH and GPG keys-\u0026gt;New GPG key and paste the public key there.\nNow go back to seahorse and copy the key ID from the properties dialog of your GPG key (double click on the key). Then you need to tell Git about your GPG key with:\ngit config --global user.signingkey \u0026lt;KEY_ID\u0026gt; (replace \u0026lt;KEY_ID\u0026gt; with your actual key ID)\nFinished! ðŸ’ª ðŸŽŠ\nFrom now on you can sign your commits with:\ngit commit -S -m \u0026#34;Hooray I can sign my commits\u0026#34; SSH key # Using SSH you do not have to enter your token or password everytime you push a commit to github. In seahorse click + then select Secure Shell key. Enter a brief description then click Create and set up and enter a passphrase. To get the public double click on the ssh key to get to the properties dialog. There is a Copy icon next to the Public Key label. After clicking it your public key is saved in your clipboard. All you have to do now is adding your SSH key to Github. Therefore sign in to your Github account and go to Settings-\u0026gt;SSH and GPG keys-\u0026gt;New SSH key. There you have a title and copy your public key in the box below.\nGreat! ðŸŽ‰ If you want to force git to always use SSH instead of HTTPS you can do that with:\ngit config --global url.\u0026#34;git@github.com:\u0026#34;.insteadOf \u0026#34;https://github.com/\u0026#34; I hoped this post helped you!

They describe the project as follows:\nApplication Indicators are a GNOME implementation of the StatusNotifierItem Specification (SNI) that was originally submitted to freedesktop.org by KDE. The Ayatana Indicator project intends to become the new upstream for application indicators and associated projects with a focus on making Ayatana Indicators a desktop agnostic technology.\nThey have some great advantages compared to the default MATE Notification Area:\nConsistent sharp rendering of status icons MPRIS-support for controlling media players Calendar Synchronization with Evolution Notification manager Pipewire # The default sound system included in the ISO is Pipewire\nPipeWire is a project that aims to greatly improve handling of audio and video under Linux. It provides a low-latency, graph based processing engine on top of audio and video devices that can be used to support the use cases currently handled by both pulseaudio and JACK. PipeWire was designed with a powerful security model that makes interacting with audio and video devices from containerized applications easy, with supporting Flatpak applications being the primary goal. Alongside Wayland and Flatpak we expect PipeWire to provide a core building block for the future of Linux application development.\nCapture and playback of audio and video with minimal latency. Real-time Multimedia processing on audio and video. Multiprocess architecture to let applications share multimedia content. Seamless support for PulseAudio, JACK, ALSA and GStreamer applications. Sandboxed applications support. See Flatpak for more info. To be in full control of your audio streams the minimal patchbay Helvum has been included\nClassy curated apps # The main applications included in the ISO are not surprising but some nice apps were included.\nThe default Browser is of course Firefox. As a default Office Suite the robust Libre Office is shipped with the beautiful Libreoffice style Yaru icon theme. Coming to Multimedia: Celluloid is the default video player and Rhythmbox as a music player. Celluloid defaults to the classic window border layout and Rhythmbox is pimped with the the Alternative Toolbar Plugin.\nTo organize your Mails the GTK-based Evolution E-Mail client is shipped, providing integration with the Ayatana Calendar Indicator.\nInstead of the rather slow stock MATE search tool, the powerful FSearch is here to let you search for files instantaneously and fast.\nFor the security of you accounts the password manager Secrets and Seahorse is installed by default.\nThe default shell is Fish, to make the command line more approacheble for new Linux users and more efficient for all users.\nMATE Layouts (based on MATE Tweak) lets you quickly switch between different panel layouts to get a user experience similiar to Windows, Mac, the old Unity or simply the productive Gnome 2 Layout which is the default one.\nApp Plugins # For Caja there is now by default the caja-admin plugin installed. So you can open directories or edit root files as administrator.\nAdditionally for the text editor Pluma the official MATE package pluma-plugin is now included by default. This transforms Pluma to a usable IDE with some plugins like bracket and word completion, quickhighlight, source-code browser:\nMiscellaneous # Themes # The default theme is now the slick looking Matcha-dark-pueril theme in a MATE green style, which I helped creating. Especially for this theme I created a custom green styled Papirus Folders for the used Papirus Icon Theme.\nFor Pluma and the MATE Terminal there is a new elegant and consistent theme: As you saw in this pictures the default font across the whole desktop is Fira Code.\nWallpapers # Here are some of wallpapers included in the ISO:\nPhoto by John Towner on Unsplash Photo by Marina Montoya on Unsplash Photo by Paul Scherer on Unsplash Photo by Scott Carroll on Unsplash Download ISO # You can download the ISO here The ISO consists of two files because Github cannot handel files larger than 2 GB.
